### Hi there ðŸ‘‹-

Iâ€™m currently working on ...
I recently finished a 3 month internship with Robbie.AI an Atento Capital port-co. I worked with React/Redux and was able to work on building UI/UX for the notification history page of the app. Working on bouth the front and backend on this was a great learning opportunity. I am now turning my focus back to my own projects. I will be getting back into my SWL app. I have finished the blog section and now will be move to the data collection part of the app. With this app I hope to build something that will help Organizations that work with homeless people by gathering data on location types of supplies needed i.e. toiletries, sleeping bags, clothes.
